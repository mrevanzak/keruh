# Privacy Policy version 1.0 for Keruh 

Keruh app does not collect any user data of any kind.  We only used Gamekit for the leaderboard.
Keruh is a single-player hyper casual game that brings environmental awareness to your fingertips. Dive into a polluted river and take control of a floating trash net. With one simple drag mechanic, swipe left and right to collect as much trash as you can before it flows downstream.
